Contingency Clauses
-------------------
The following clauses provide for continuity of the mod in case of unforeseen circumstances.  
Note that these permissions may be modified or revoked without notice at any time, for any reason.

**A: Recompiling for compatibility with new versions of KSP**

In the event that:
- A new version of KSP (excluding pre-release versions) causes the existing release of the mod to cease functioning correctly.
- The incompatibility can be resolved by recompiling the mod's source code, *without modification*, against the new KSP version.
- The author/maintainer of the mod has shown no activity on both the KSP forums and on GitHub for a continuous duration of ten (10) days.
- A post in the mod's forum thread, @mentioning the author/maintainer, has not received a response after an *additional* five (5) days.

When *all* of the above conditions have been met, permission is granted to recompile the source code, *as-is and without modification*, and make the resulting binaries (.dll only) available as a patch by posting in the mod's KSP forum thread.  
Such a patch:
- Must use only source code that corresponds to the most recent officially released version of the mod. Do *not* use any code that has not yet been incorporated into an official release, even if it is available on GitHub.
- Must be offered as a *patch*, containing binaries only, that has to be manually applied on top of the most recent official release. Do not package into or present as a complete release. Do not assign a new version number. Do not submit to automated installation tools for indexing.
- Must be clearly marked as an UNOFFICIAL recompile, indicate the KSP version number that it is compiled for, and note the version number of the source code that was used. For example:  
`<mod name>-UNOFFICIAL-recompile-of-<existing mod version number>-for-<KSP version number>`
- Must not require payment, and may not be used to solicit for donations.
- Must be removed upon being superseded by an official release of the mod, or upon request of the mod author/maintainer. The patch file download must be hosted in a location that enables removal.
- Continues to be bound by the same license terms as the mod.


**B: Modifying for compatibility with new versions of KSP**

In the event that:
- A new version of KSP (excluding pre-release versions) causes the existing release of the mod to cease functioning correctly.
- The incompatibility cannot be resolved by a simple recompilation, and would require modification of the mod's source code.
- The author/maintainer of the mod has shown no activity on both the KSP forums and on GitHub for a continuous duration of thirty (30) days.
- A post in the mod's forum thread, @mentioning the author/maintainer, has not received a response after an *additional* ten (10) days.

When *all* of the above conditions have been met, permission is granted to implement the necessary changes for compatibility with KSP, and make the resulting binaries (.dll only) available as a patch by posting in the mod's KSP forum thread.  
Such a patch:
- May only address compatibility issues with KSP, and must not introduce new features or functionality.
- Should generally use only source code that corresponds to the most recent officially released version of the mod.
    - Any existing *bugfix* code on GitHub that has not yet been incorporated into an official release may be included in the patch, but this is *at your own risk* as such code is not guaranteed to be in a completed state.
    - New *feature* code may not be included under any under circumstance.
- Must be offered as a *patch*, containing binaries only, that has to be manually applied on top of the most recent official release. Do not package into or present as a complete release. Do not assign a new version number. Do not submit to automated installation tools for indexing.
- Must be clearly marked as an UNOFFICIAL patch, indicate the KSP version number that it is compiled for, and note the version number of the mod that the patch should be applied to. For example:  
`<mod name>-UNOFFICIAL-patch-for-<existing mod version number>-for-<KSP version number>`  
The source code must be made publicly available to comply with the official Add-on Posting Rules.
- Must not require payment, and may not be used to solicit for donations.
- Must be removed upon being superseded by an official release of the mod, or upon request of the mod author/maintainer. The patch file download must be hosted in a location that enables removal.
- Continues to be bound by the same license terms as the mod.


**C: Adoption of orphaned project**

In the event that:
- The author/maintainer of the mod has shown no activity on both the KSP forums and on GitHub for a continuous duration of five (5) months after a patch targeting the most recent version of the mod available on GitHub has been released by exercising clause (B) above.
- A further attempt to make contact with the author/maintainer by *all* of the following means has not received a response after an *additional* fifteen (15) days:
    - @mention in the mod's forum thread
	- personal messaging on the KSP forums
	- [posting a GitHub issue on this project](https://github.com/cake-pie/AirlockPlus/issues), clearly indicating an intent to adopt the project

When *all* of the above conditions have been met, the most recent version of the mod, along with the source code available on GitHub, shall be released under a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 International license, subject to the following:
- The name of the mod must be changed in some manner, to reflect that it is a fork of the original.
- Using a variation of the original name, such as "AirlockPlus Continued" or similar, is permitted if and only if the forked project is a faithful continuation that provides fundamentally unchanged functionality as per the description in [README.md](https://github.com/cake-pie/AirlockPlus/blob/master/README.md). To preserve the originally intended scope of the mod and prevent feature creep, unrelated features should not be added or subtracted.
- All derivative work must credit this original version, in order to comply with the attribution requirement of CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0. A link back to [the original project](https://github.com/cake-pie/AirlockPlus) is recommended. See [here](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#how-do-i-properly-attribute-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license) for further guidance on proper attribution.


**D: Unavailability of official KSP forums**

In the event that the KSP forums at http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com cease to exist without an official replacement, the requirements for attempting to establish contact with the mod author/maintainer in clauses A, B and C above may be fulfilled instead by [posting a GitHub issue on this project](https://github.com/cake-pie/AirlockPlus/issues).
