Guidelines
----------
Localization is not merely a matter of grabbing a text file and translating it!  While the localized text needs to convey the intended meaning, word-for-word translation is *not* the main goal.  Here are some other considerations to keep in mind:
- Context is important.  Where is the text string used?  How much space is available?  Should the text be a concise prompt, or give detailed instructions?
- Mods should fit in well with the main game in terms of behavior and "look and feel", so as to maintain a sense of familiarity and continuity for players.  This means that for stock-supported languages, it is desirable to remain consistent with the official localization in terms of word choices and sentence structure.  Likewise, for community-supported languages, it is best to conform with the community translation for the main game.
