AirlockPlus
===========

A mod for [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com).  
[KSP Forum Thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=160268)

AirlockPlus allows the use of any airlock on a vessel in conjunction with any crew part on the vessel:
- A kerbal on EVA can use any airlock to board any part of the vessel, not just the part that the airlock is attached to.
- A kerbal in any part of the vessel can go EVA using any airlock on the vessel, not just the airlock(s) on the part that they currently occupy.
- All of this happens seamlessly -- no need to manually transfer kerbals between parts.
- Works even if the airlock part is already full of other kerbals. 

With this mod, it becomes possible to use crew cabins that don't have airlocks, and airlock parts that don't have any crew capacity of their own. 

For further information and documentation, please consult the forum thread for the mod.
